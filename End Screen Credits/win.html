        <h1 id="text">Congratulations on Escaping the Mansion</h1>
        <!-- <p id="text">As you exit the mansion you see the final door you walk through close,<br>
             and you see the thing chasing you look at you through the window and you relise<br>
            </p> -->
        
            <p  class="paragraph quintessential-regular" style="color: #0f52ba;">
            You push open the final door, the heavy wood groaning under your weight.<br>
            A rush of cold night air washes over you, sending a shiver down your spine. You're outside. <br>
            The moon hangs low in the sky, casting its pale glow over the mansion's overgrown garden.<br> 
            The path ahead is barely visible through the mist, but you don't care, you just run.<br>
            Behind you, the mansion looms, its dark windows like empty eyes watching you go.<br>
            For a moment, you expect to hear the thing's footsteps, feel its breath<br>
            on your neck. But there's only silence.<br>
            Then, as you cross the threshold of the rusted iron gates,<br>
            the mansion lets out a deep, groaning sigh. The walls tremble. The very air seems to crackle.<br>
            And in the blink of an eye, it's gone? Nothing remains but an empty clearing and<br> 
            the lingering chill of something that should not have been.<br>
            You're free. But as you stand there, catching your breath, a thought creeps into your mind.<br> 
            Was it ever real?<br>
            And then, somewhere in the distance.
